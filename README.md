# Business-Analyst-Project---MedicAid-003

Project Mandate

Background
 This project aims at creating a website for a Hospital based in the UK, they bridge the gap between Doctors and Patients by providing a platform where patients can schedule appointments easily, purchase medical products and medication, make payment on the website and pick up products when they visit the hospital.  
The doctors can update their availability on the website and also senior management can track their daily schedules there.

The Problem
There are lots of people out there seeking to visit the hospital for one medical reason or another, but their busy schedule and sometimes ill health makes it quite difficult for them go to the hospitals and sit for hours waiting for the line to get to them, and many times they have to return the next day, making it a more frustrating experience.

Our client aims to solve this problem by creating an application that would create a platform where that interaction between doctor and patient becomes less tedious and more convenient for both parties.

The Patient can schedule appointments online and get booked in with a doctor relevant to their specific need, they also have access to the hospitals pharmacy online where they get to see available products(medical) on the website, make an order, pay and pick it up (with a prescription where needed) when they visit the hospital.

The cost of delivering this project has been budgeted at Â£65,000.

This is a huge project and so it has been split into different groups, below are the features that this team would be working on:

Key Features - Website Features.
Accounts, FAQ's, Blog, Search, Order and Pick Up and Client Profile.

1. Accounts: This feature manages the accounts of admin and patients on the application. Each user should be able to sign up to the platform, sign in and manage their accounts.

2. FAQ'S- This feature helps to manage frequently asked questions regarding the business process, how to use products and which products to use. Only the admin user can upload, edit and delete data but all users can view the details on this feature.

3. Blog: This feature should enable the admin users send out customized newsletters or any type of information needed to be divulged to the public, and all visitors to the website can always view available news and other information from the blog feature. The admin users should be able to edit, delete and upload any information as required.

4. Search :This feature ensures that customers on the website can search/filter easily through the sections of the website for easy access to information..

5. Order & Pick up: With this feature, patients can view a history of orders they have placed, both past and pending orders, this feature also gives details of pick up dates.

6. Client Profile: Registered users can view their details on this feature, make changes to their details, upload, edit and delete profile pictures, change password and even delete the account if needed.

Main Aim:
1. For revenue generation.
2. To better their business process by creating an avenue that simplifies the way patients interact with the hospital..
3. To provide quality & affordable services to its users.
4. To create better visibility for the business.

Team members on this project are tasked with delivering this project within 12 weeks.

Kindly note that the team would be building an MVP (minimum viable product) so our main focus would be on the primary functionalities of the product.
